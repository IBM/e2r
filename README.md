# Quantum Embedding of the Knowledge (NeurIPS 2019)

A novel approach proposed (by Knowledge & Reasoning Group at IBM Research AI, India) to embed symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), inspired by the theory of Quantum Logic. The goal is to be able to replicate the logical structure of the KB and symbolic logical reasoning in the embedding space. We call this approach E2R (Embed2Reason).

# Inductive Quantum Embedding (NeurIPS 2020)

In this work we extend our NeurIPS 2019 paper. The original QE idea, is limited to the transductive (not inductive) setting. Moreover, the original QE scheme runs quite slow on real applications involving millions of entities. This work alleviates both of these key limitations. As an application, we show that one can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the well-known NLP task of fine-grained entity type classification by using the inductive QE approach.
