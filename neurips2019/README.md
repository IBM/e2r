Quantum embedding is a novel approach, proposed by the Knowledge & Reasoning Group at IBM Research AI, India, to embed symbolic Knowledge Base (KB). Inspired by the theory of Quantum Logic, the goal is to replicate the logical structure of the KB in the embedding space. As a result we want to be able to mimic symbolic logical reasoning in the embedding space. We named this approach as E2R (Embed2Reason).
